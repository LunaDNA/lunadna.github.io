## Welcome to LunaDNA's Engineering Blog

Hi there! This blog is an ongoing discussion of topics that we engineers at LunaDNA find ourselves entrenched in from time to time. Here, you can observe some of the trials and tribulations, successes and failures, design decisions and just plain hacks we implement in order to create and expand the LunaDNA platform. We love to learn and are ever curious, just like you. As you read through, try to voice your own thoughts on how you would tackle a problem, or even detail your own experiences that you've had building secure web APIs. Learn more about [LunaPBC](https://lunapbc.com) and [LunaDNA](https://lunadna.com), participate in the LunaDNA platform and help contribute to medical research worldwide!
